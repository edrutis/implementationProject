# Welcome to my software implementation project for Spring 2023

I am creating a rental app that allows end users to pick a specific vehicle rather than just a classification

# Progress
I have developed much of the front end and back end at this point. I have primarily focused on admin user functionality so far.This will be vital in testing out functionality for other user types

## Admin functions
- New Car
- New Location
- View Cars by location
- View Car
- Delete Location

#Tech Stack

Database: MongoDB on Atlas
Backend: NestJS running locally on Node via Yarn
Frontend: React running locally on Node via Yarn
Extra packages: Tailwind for styling, Axios for API calls
